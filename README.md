# Registered-Vechicles-Data-Analysis
This project consists of a detalied data analysis of registered vehicles in Romania. I conducted several studies on different types of vehicles and their distribution among Romania's counties, regions and macro-regions using python libraries like pandas, matplotlib and scipy. I have imported the information from the following source: http://statistici.insse.ro:8077/tempo-online/#/pages/tables/insse-table (Statistică economică (B) -> Transporturi -> Transport rutier). It is the most trusted statistics website nationwide.
# Please be advised
The code and documentation are written in Romanian language.
